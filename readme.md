# Terror_Flask
## Intro

This is another terrorism project however, I do not intend for it to be as expansive as my other projects. The dataset, as usual, came from Kaggle. Specific site is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/newamerica/terrorist-activity

This project originally came from my US_terror project but once I finished
that project, I decided to turn it into a flask program. I figured that it would
be easy to do and give me more practice with Flask. I could also apply some
of the techniques that I have been learning in my web development class.

I do have to say that doing terrorism projects gets old but I needed another project to do and the data was there. So, decided why not. Also, even though I have done terrorism projects on Europe and the world I have never done one specifically on the U.S. I do have to admit and stress that I do have a background in International Relations and political science so I love to do these types of projects! It is a way for me to merge two of my passions together. Oh, and I will say that this project does not have a backend. Instead,
I pull all of my data from the CSV file. 

One final comment, I noticed that the 2008 Mumbai, India terrorist attacks were in the CSV file. Not sure if other global terrorist attacks are in the file but I guess this is not for the US only. Thus, I am sorry for the bad name of calling this project US terrorist attacks.
